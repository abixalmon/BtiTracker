www.xbtit.com making it easy to own a tracker, my cat has a tracker and she is no PHP guru ...

here are some pointers for novice and expert alike. first decide what you want:

QUESTION: internal PHP tracker or xbtt?
xbtt is recommended but you need root access to your server. the PHP tracker can handle 5-10,000 peers but creates a high volume of hits on your webserver. if you intend in time to migrate to xbtt then START with xbtt (those legacy PHP torrents will be a burden on your server for as long as they live, think about it)

QUESTION: internal forum or smf?
smf is the best but the internal forum is good, and you can migrate the site to smf at any time with our easy import script

- PHP TRACKER AND INTERNAL FORUM -
this is the easiest and fastest way to get your tracker up and running

4. follow the instructions on the screen
5. delete install.php
6. enter the admin control panel and set your tracker's URL and announce URL's (delete the xbtt example announce with the :2710) and set your preferences ... save

NOTES:
- xbtt installs with auto_register = 1 which means people can use your tracker without uploading ...
- the default xbtit tracker config needs your attention, i have made settings in there which you want to change 100%, look for them and learn your system (the tracker timings are all good)
- look to your Users Group Settings, do they match what you want?
- you need to create the boards for your internal forum
- it is a lot of new stuff to take in, visit us at btiteam.org for free opensource support
- for the adventurous, the latest (unstable) revision of xbtit is available at:
svn co https://btit-tracker.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/btit-tracker/BtitT2/branches/beta
