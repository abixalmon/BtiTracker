xbtit v.2.1
-----------
fixed all known bugs and security problems

xbtit v.2
---------
There is really a lot of changes, all files are different, it's not possible to upgrade a modified Btit 1.4.x without doing standard database upgrade (using upgrade.php) and then applying hacks again on your new installed clean xbtit. Please note that you'll have an easy way to install hacks, but all existing hacks need to be packaging (at the moment not one is done). 
Now let's go with major changes list (new features only):

- real template system, 99% of the html code is out for the php files using bTemplate (http://www.massassi.com/bTemplate/)
- rewritten (a little optimized) announce.php (for internal tracker)
- support for xbtt (http://xbtt.sourceforge.net/tracker/) backend by Olaf Van der Spek
- support for external mail server using phpmailer (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer)
- rewritten internal forum from scratch with subforum support
- support for smf forum (http://www.simplemachines.org/) instead of internal (big thanks to petr1fied)
- "one click hack installer", an easy way to install hacks into your tracker (a working example is provided)
- modules support
- new online procedure
- new AJAX shoutbox (big thanks to miskotes)
- Xss/SQL injection protection with log insertion (thank you cobracrk)
- new AJAX polls system (thank you to Ripper)
- new design (4 styles provided by TreepTopClimber)
- Rss reader (only class, with example in admincp for btiteam.org latest news)
- basic cache system
- new language system (array is used instead of constant)
- smf_import script to import standard internal forum and users to smf (thank you again to petr1fied)

Don't remember other "major" changes, you should know that xBtit asked a lot of work and test, thank you to all
- developers
- testers
- forum admins
- users
