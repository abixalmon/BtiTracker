The script in this version is very very different than the original one, but we are pleased to leave the 
credits from previous version from which this is born. ;)

This tracker as the origine from a frontend for DeHackEd's tracker, aka phpBTTracker (now almost inexistant). 
We aim to make a nice user interface and a good admin tool at the same time.
Some code and some ideas came from other trackers:
- torrentbits (http://www.torrentbits.org - dead)
- torrenttrader (http://www.torrentrader.org)
- bytemoonsoon (deadlink)
- Tbdev: CoLdFuSiOn (http://www.tbdev.net)
- Xbtt: Olaf van der Spek (http://xbtt.sourceforge.net)
- phpmailer (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer)
- Smf (http://www.simplemachines.org/)
- bTemplate: Brian Lozier (http://www.massassi.com/bTemplate)

the rest has been coded, designed and thought up from scratch.
